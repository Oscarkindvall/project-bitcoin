## Why the React framework 

First of all, and probably the main reason, we chose React due to the fact that we had used it before and therefor was a bit familiar with in comparison to other frameworks. Further, from usability perspective React are not that difficult to manage if you have some JavaScript knowledge. Of course, other frameworks may as well be easy to learn with some skill in JavaScript. However, React has gained popularity where a large contributing factor is the ease of learning the framework. Leaving us with another argument for choosing React.

Since we are beginners in both JavaScript and overall programming, when deciding we focused a lot on the community around the framework. The bigger and stronger community, the better help and guidance would we receive. Angular for example, is famous for its strong community. However, React offers a pretty strong community as well, with loads of contributors and free tutorials. The community in combination with the fact that the framework is easy to learn played the biggest part of our decision.

Further, our aim was to build using web apis, where React is famous for its performance regarding web applications and Angular on the other hand is more famous for low performance, but with more focus on complex applications. Since we choose CoinDesk API and among others wanted to show bitcoin value over dates as well as an option for choosing dates, we read there was complementary libraries like apex charts and datepicker, which we found interesting. In other words, yet another reason for choosing React. Angular and Vue could probably offer the same and maybe even more. But since React offered what we needed in combination with our familiarity with the framework as well as the large community, our decision was clear.
